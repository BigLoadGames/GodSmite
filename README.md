# God Smite!
To play, go to [this webpage](http://bigloadgames.github.io/GodSmite/), or download the files yourself and run locally.

The point of this repo is not to make a game, although that is a product, but to learn pure javascript through coding in javascript. All code that I have written is pure javascript. Some code uses jquery, but that code was not written by me, and exists only to make the game playable, or to style the website (sweet alert).

I would encourage anyone who is interested to contribute, but if you plan to do so, please first read the section on contribution.

# Contribution
If you want to write code for this repo, please try to refrain from using any form of javascript other than vanilla. You may use jquery or another library, but only if it is absolutely necessary to complete the task you wish to accomplish.
